    /** SOME EXTRAS:
     *  You may in some cases wish to COMPLETELY DISALLOW any possibility of calling a class' Copy-ctor (e.g. you create a "utility" class which only implements static methods, therefore
     *  there is no sense of a class instance to exist, or you create a "singleton" class, for which only a single object can exist at any given time)
     *  In such cases you can put the Copy-ctor under the private access-specifier level -e.g. make it inaccessible from outside the class-
     *  You can do that generally with any member function but usually the consequences and additional considerations (e.g. implicit Copy-ctor calls by returning/passing by-Value,
     *  or copy-initializations ,even when the Copy-ctor is "ellided") can be hard to take care of and some times will produce warnings instead of direct compilation errors

     * a) when called on a const object the const variant will be selected 
     *    e.g. const Department d1; d1.GetRoster();  //chooses const-qualified version (d1 object is const)
     *         Department d2; const Department* d2_p=&d2; d2->GetRoster();  //chooses const-qualified version (d2 object is not const, but function is called through d2_p which points to const data)
     * b) when called on a non-const object and a non-const variant exists, the non-const variant will be preferred
     *    e.g. Department d2; d2.GetRoster();  //chooses the non-const-qualified version
